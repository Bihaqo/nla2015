So the guy randomly walks through the graph and the eigenvector we are looking for is exactly his stationary distribution â€” for each node it tells you the probability of visiting this particular node.

    "Recommender systems are gaining more and more popularity. They're used in a broad range of areas: music, movies, e-commerce, social and professional networks, online news to name a few. Web services like Pandora, Netflix and Amazon build and deploy their own recommender engines in order to make customers happier and generate additional revenue. Those companies, and many others, take the problem of building high-quality recommender system very seriously. One of many examples of a great interest in this area coming from industries is the famous [Netflix competition](http://www.netflixprize.com/rules) with **$1million** prize for winners.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task you'll build a very simple yet powerfull engine for recommender system. Given the [Movielens 10M](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data you'll implement an SVD-based model of movie recommendation system. SVD-based approach belongs to a family of collaborative filtering algorithms that use matrix factorization (MF). While there are many sophisticated algorithms for MF, pure SVD remains one of the [top-performers](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221141030_Performance_of_recommender_algorithms_on_top-N_recommendation_tasks). The main idea behind these algorithms is to represent each user and each movie as vectors in some low-dimensional feature space. That low-dimensional space(or ***latent factors space***) shows what features a user likes and which of them are present in a movie. Interpreting those features is a separate and hard task and we will simply build the latent factors using SVD without focusing on the intrinsic meaning of those features. With this model the \"likeability\" of a movie for a particular user is estimated by a weighted inner product of their latent factors. The model should also respond fast and produce recommendations right after a new user demonstrated some of his preferences. Recomputing SVD for this task may take prohibitively long time that's why we'll use folding-in technique for making fresh recommendations quickly.\n",
