    "### Prerequisites \n",
    "The main prerequisite is the motivation work with [us](oseledets.github.io): our group is big, and we are always quite helpful, even if you are not a master in the particular topic. However it is a good idea that you know linear algebra (or at least learning it). For machine-learning related projects, machine learning experience is a good idea, for PDE-related it not bad  to have a basic knowledge about finite differences and/or finite elements. Many projects are related to **tensor train** and **quantized tensor train** decompositions: this is our \"special feature\", which you will surely need to learn. Also, all the projects are related to programming and Python is the preferred language.\n",

    "1. Do a literature survey. [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com) will help you. Read all the papers you can find on the topic, not only the particular ones that the advisor has given to you. Follow the references in the papers, find keywords, define key ideas.\n",

    "2. Find appropriate software and baseline algorithm. Typically, you are not the one solving a particular problem: look for the same projects, what was their approach and try to identify possible improvements\n",
